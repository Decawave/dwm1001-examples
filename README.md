# FORK OF dwm1001-examples
## Overview

This project contains C simple examples for DWM1001 hardware and its derivatives, such as the DWM1001-DEV board.

The DWM1001 module is a Ultra Wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth hardware based on DecaWave's DW1000 IC and Nordic Semiconductor nrF52832 SoC. It allows to build a scalable Two-Way-Ranging (TWR) RTLS systems with up to thousands of tags. 

The DWM1001-DEV is a development board for the DWM1001 module. It contains an integrated Jlink to facilitate development and debbuging.
For more information about DWM1001, please visit www.decawave.com.

The C simple examples allow user to discover the key functionalities offered by the DWM1001 and UWB. These examples are customized for DWM1001-DEV, and some modifications will be necessary to port them to other DWM1001 based hardware (in particular LED and button interface)

The project is built as follow :

## Supported IDE

The examples are ready to use with the following IDE :
* Segger Embedded Studio (SES)

## Segger Embedded Studio

Each example contains a emproject project file for SES. The examples compile and load cleanly to the DWM1001.   
The project was created with the SES version V3.34a. 

SES has a free license for nrF52832 development. Consequently, this IDE can be used without any limitation for DWM1001 development.

### SES : Additional Package

When using SES IDE, you will need to install the following package :

Package                                                                                                                           
CMSIS 5 CMSIS-CORE Support Package (version 5.02)                                                                           
CMSIS-CORE Support Package (version 4.05)                                                                           
Nordic Semiconductor nRF CPU Support Package (version 1.06)                                                                           

They can be install from SES itself, through the package manager in the tools menu. 

## Example Details 

The SS-TWR scheme can be implemented using two DWM1001 modules, the first one programmed as an initiator and the second one as a responder.

### Single Sided Two Way Ranging -- Initiator

This example contains the source code for the initiator. The initiator will send a frame, wait for the response from the receiver, calculate the distance and output it on the UART (can be observed on a serial terminal)

```
dwm1001-keil-examples/examples/ss_twr_init/
├── config                    // Contains sdk_config.h file for nrF SDK 14.2 customization
├── main.c                    // Initialization and main program
├── ss_init_main.c            // Single sided initiator core program
├── UART                      // Uart 
├── SES
│   └── ss_twr_init.emProject // Segger Embedded Studio project
└── Keil uvision
     └── ss_twr_init.uvprojx  // Keil uvision project

```
The application function is detailed in the main.c and the ss_init_main.c files. 

Calibration may be necessary in order to have an accurate measurement. It can be done by adjusting the antenna delay which is hardware dependent. 

### Single Sided Two Way Ranging -- Responder

This example contains the source code for the responder. The receiver will receive a frame from the initiator and send the corresponding answer.

```

### Two Wire Interface Accelerometer

This example implements a TWI between the LIS2DH12 and the nrF52832. 
The blue led will be on when a motion is detected by the LIS2DH12. It also reports the accelerometer state on the UART.
