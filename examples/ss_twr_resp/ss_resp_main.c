*  @brief   Single-sided two-way ranging (SS TWR) responder example code
*
*           This is a simple code example which acts as the responder in a SS TWR distance measurement exchange. 
*           This application waits for a "poll" message (recording the RX time-stamp of the poll) expected from 
*           the "SS TWR initiator" example code (companion to this application), and
*           then sends a "response" message recording its TX time-stamp.
*
*           Notes at the end of this file, to expand on the inline comments.

* NOTES:
*
* 1. This is the task delay when using FreeRTOS. Task is delayed a given number of ticks. Useful to be able to define this out to see the effect of the RTOS
*    on timing.
* 2. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
*    following:
*     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
*     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
*       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
*    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
*     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
*     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
*     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
*     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 3 below.
*     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 3 below.
*     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
*    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
*    Poll message:
*     - no more data
*    Response message:
*     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
*     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
*    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW1000.
* 3. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
*    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
*    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
* 4. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
*    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
*    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
* 5. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
*    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
*    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
*    bytes.
* 6. POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS is a critical value for porting to different processors. For slower platforms where the SPI is at a slower speed 
*    or the processor is operating at a lower frequency (Comparing to STM32F, SPI of 18MHz and Processor internal 72MHz)this value needs to be increased.
*    Knowing the exact time when the responder is going to send its response is vital for time of flight calculation. The specification of the time of 
*    respnse must allow the processor enough time to do its calculations and put the packet in the Tx buffer. So more time required for a slower
*    system(processor).
* 7. As we want to send final TX timestamp in the final message, we have to compute it in advance instead of relying on the reading of DW1000
*    register. Timestamps and delayed transmission time are both expressed in device time units so we just have to add the desired response delay to
*    response RX timestamp to get final transmission time. The delayed transmission time resolution is 512 device time units which means that the
*    lower 9 bits of the obtained value must be zeroed. This also allows to encode the 40-bit value in a 32-bit words by shifting the all-zero lower
*    8 bits.
* 8. In this operation, the high order byte of each 40-bit timestamps is discarded. This is acceptable as those time-stamps are not separated by
*    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays (needed in the
*    time-of-flight computation) can be handled by a 32-bit subtraction.
* 9. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
*    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
*    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
*10. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
*    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
